# This is the very first web page
Welcome! This is the first web page created, and is created using the skills learned in 
the HTML fundamentals, and CSS Fundamentals modules of the Fullstack web development course 
from the Code Institute.

## HTML Elements
A lot of the general HTML Elements were used to create this site. These were to build the main
body of the web page, and included a navigation bar using an unordered list, headings, divs, 
anchors and images

## CSS Elements
A link to an external CSS style sheet was included in the < head> section of the HTML page.
The CSS style sheet is used to define fonts, colours, margins, padding and various other settings
for each type of HTML element, which can then by used when loading the page.

### Overview of web site
The web site uses a navigation bar which links to three different pages, 
"Stream one"; "Stream two"; Stream three". <BR>
Each of these 3 pages contain images for various web development tools, and provides links to a 
discriptive wikipedia page which provides further information on the tools and their uses.
